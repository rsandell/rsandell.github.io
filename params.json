{"name":"Robert Sandell","tagline":"Software Engineering, The World and Me","body":"## About\r\nI am a software engineer with a focus on integration and development of software development tools, mostly Java related.\r\n\r\nI started my tools career in the Java R&D department at Sony Ericsson _(now [Sony Mobile](http://www.sonymobile.com/))_ int the team that developed and maintained the J2ME SDK. Got bitten by the [JUnit](http://junit.org/) bug and moved on to more quality and auto testing related tools.\r\n\r\nNow I am the lead engineer for the [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) system based on [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) used by the Software R&D Organisation at [Sony Mobile](http://www.sonymobile.com/).\r\n\r\nI made my first contribution to the Jenkins Community in 2010 with the [Gerrit Trigger Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger) and have since then considered that community my home.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\n[@robert_sandell](https://twitter.com/robert_sandell)  \r\n[+Robert Sandell](gplus.to/rsandell)  \r\n[Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/rsandell)  \r\n[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/robertsandell)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
